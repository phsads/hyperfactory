	<div>Controls: </div>
	<div>- WASD to move </div>
	<div>- There are 5 different cursor modes (use E to swap): </div>
	<div>	+ Interact: Hold left click over a vein to mine it, hold click over a manual machine (anvil and workstation) to run it.</div>
	<div>	+ Place: Left click to place machines, right click to destroy them </div>
	<div>	+ Logic: Left click to modify the IO, right click to move the slot, enabled side will allow auto output (machine - machine output does not work)</div>
	<div>	+ CN: Modifies circuit number, LMB to increase, RMB to decrease, hold SHIFT for 10, CTRL for 100. </div>
	<div>	+ I/O: Manual Extract/Insert, LClick/RClick to move the machine slot, I to do the I/O </div>
	<div>- 1-9 for inventory slots </div>
	<div>- \ to delete 1 item (that you're holding) </div>
	<div>- P to compress items </div>
	<div>- , to summon a workstation (you can only do it once every 10 mins)</div>
	<br> <br>
	<div>PROGRESSION:</div>
	<div>Stone Age:</div>
	<div>- Start by summoning a workstation and place it near (ToI reference) veins (all of them).</div>
	<div>- Harvest the veins, and craft them into these 2 machines: Furnace and Anvil (for the recipes chance .../guide.html to .../recipes.html).</div>
	<div>- Each circuit number is a different recipe, modify them accordingly to run the recipe.</div>
	<div>- Primitive machines (anvil, workstation) can be powered simply by holding left click in the Interact mode.</div>
	<div>- Keep crafting until you get your first steam machine, the steam boiler.</div>
	<br>
	<div>Steam Age:</div>
	<div>- Start by getting a bunch more steam machines (Steam Harvester and Deposit Miner allowed for automation of resources).</div>
	<div>- The Steam Harvester mines out the vein blocks (that you can see and harvest manually). The vein blocks have a very very low chance to dissapear when mined (both manually and automatically).</div>
	<div>- The Steam Deposit Miner mines ores (or fluids) underground that you can not see. Each 9x9 area has their own deposit (marked by the white lines). Each deposit can have from 1 to 3 things, and they can run out.</div>
	<div>- Using the Steam Deposit Miner, make steel (which unlocks some new items).</div>
	<div>- Using a lot of resources you've accumulated, make your first T1 circuits (Not Even a Circuit) and make the Steam Assembler.</div>
	<div>- </div>
	<div>- Congratulations, you have completed the Steam Age though I'd recommend automating basic materials before you step in the first energy tier: Low Voltage (totally not inspired by GregTech).</div>
	<div>- Another tip for the upcoming age is to make a lot more items than you need (example: Make 16 T1 circuits) .</div>
